This is my notebook that retrieves data from the mulitple api's that cover radio navigational warngings across the Baltic Sea. It then plots all current warnings in a map.

The websites used can be found here: https://gis.vta.ee/nutimeri/ and https://niord.dma.dk/#/

I built this project due to ongoing rises in tensions surrounding the baltic sea. Having it all stored in one place using ipfs allows me to track past incidents.
I think this information could be very valuable to government agencies where they have it all in one place. I plan to include more regions around the world such as the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf.
